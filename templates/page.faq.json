            "answer": "<p>Mostly with love and care :), but if there’s a stain, you can also use a damp cloth and some gentle detergent to treat the spot. If your jacket needs a deeper cleaning, you can also use the washing machine at 30 degrees Celsius with a gentle detergent. In general, we recommend to hang your jacket up afterwards to airdry. To know if your jacket can be put in the dryer, you can consult the care label in the jacket, as that differentiates with every jacket. Please never use bleach, as that will cause damage to the fabric and waterproofness, and we don’t want that! Most items are made of a waterproof fabric that is additionally treated with a water repellent finish so moisture drops off the fabric. After you’ve loved your GOFRANCK for a while the finish might need a boost and we recommend to treat the jacket with our Organotex X GOFRANCK Water Repellent Spray so you can love your GOFRANCK longer.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>How waterproof a jacket is depending on the material that’s being used and if the seams are taped. Most GOFRANCK jackets are fully taped, but not all. The waterproofness of the jacket is always mentioned in the style specifications.<br/>Please also note that there is a difference between waterproof and water repellent. Waterproof jackets have all or critical seams taped and can withstand rain without being penetrated. With water repellent jackets, some moisture will bead off the fabric, but it can’t withstand rainfall or a lot of moisture. It is always mentioned in the style specifications how waterproof or water repellent a jacket is.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Imagine a square tube of 30 mm x 30 mm that is placed on top of the fabric and is filled with water while measuring the height of the water. The height of the water says something about the amount of pressure the fabric can withstand before the water will penetrate the fabric. That is how Water Column Pressure is measured. So, a Water Column Pressure of 20K means that the fabric can withstand 20.000 mm of water pressure.</p>"

After some time, the water repellent finish gets worn off. To give this finish a boost and make the lifespan of your GOFRANCK longer, it is necessary to treat your jacket with the Organotex X GOFRANCK Water Repellent Spray from time to time.</p>"
